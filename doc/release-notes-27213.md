P2P and network changes
------

- Nodes with multiple reachable networks will actively try to have at least one
  outbound connection to each network. This improves individual resistance to
  eclipse attacks and network level resistance to partition attacks. Users no
  longer need to perform active measures to ensure being connected to multiple
  enabled networks.
