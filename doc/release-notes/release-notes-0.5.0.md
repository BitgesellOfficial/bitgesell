For Ubuntu users, there is a new ppa maintained by Matt Corallo which you can add to your system so that it will automatically keep BGL up-to-date.  Just type "sudo apt-add-repository ppa:BGL/BGL" in your terminal, then install the BGL-qt package.

MAJOR BUG FIX  (CVE-2011-4447)

The wallet encryption feature introduced in BGL version 0.4.0 did not sufficiently secure the private keys. An attacker who
managed to get a copy of your encrypted wallet.dat file might be able to recover some or all of the unencrypted keys and steal the
associated coins.

If you have a previously encrypted wallet.dat, the first time you run BGL-qt or BGLd the wallet will be rewritten, BGL will
shut down, and you will be prompted to restart it to run with the new, properly encrypted file.

If you had a previously encrypted wallet.dat that might have been copied or stolen (for example, you backed it up to a public
location) you should send all of your BGLs to yourself using a new BGL address and stop using any previously generated addresses.

Wallets encrypted with this version of BGL are written properly.

Technical note: the encrypted wallet's 'keypool' will be regenerated the first time you request a new BGL address; to be certain that the
new private keys are properly backed up you should:

1. Run BGL and let it rewrite the wallet.dat file

2. Run it again, then ask it for a new BGL address.
BGL-Qt: Address Book, then New Address...
BGLd: run the 'walletpassphrase' RPC command to unlock the wallet,  then run the 'getnewaddress' RPC command.

3. If your encrypted wallet.dat may have been copied or stolen, send  all of your BGLs to the new BGL address.

4. Shut down BGL, then backup the wallet.dat file.
IMPORTANT: be sure to request a new BGL address before backing up, so that the 'keypool' is regenerated and backed up.

"Security in depth" is always a good idea, so choosing a secure location for the backup and/or encrypting the backup before uploading it is recommended. And as in previous releases, if your machine is infected by malware there are several ways an attacker might steal your BGLs.

Thanks to Alan Reiner (etotheipi) for finding and reporting this bug.
